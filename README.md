# Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis

## Business Problem
Hotel cancellations create revenue loss and forecasting challenges.  
This project analyzes booking behavior and customer reviews to predict
cancellations and identify managerial actions to reduce risk.

## Data & Methods
- Booking and customer data (~15,000 observations)
- CRISP-DM framework
- Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks
- Additional analyses: Market Basket Analysis, Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modeling

## Key Insights
- Long lead times and refundable/no-deposit bookings increase cancellation risk
- Online travel agencies show higher cancellation rates
- Customer engagement (special requests, repeat guests) lowers risk
- Reviews emphasize cleanliness, staff behavior, and breakfast quality

## Business Recommendations
- Apply stricter refund policies for high-risk segments
- Encourage customer engagement and loyalty programs
- Use predictive flags to proactively manage risky bookings
